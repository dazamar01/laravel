# laravel
Demo project for Laravel web/rest api


## 1. Setting the db
you can go to ./laravel/bd in order to find the db scripts... just run in order

## Optional
if you need/want to create a new one project, you can try with:

  composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel laravel

Maybe this code above will take a few minutes.

## 2. Starting the project

Go inside the project and start the project with artisan serve

  cd laravel/

  php artisan serve
